{"page":0,"change":"Addition","str":"At the end of a thoughtful article on the future of nuclear war, Wiesner and York (1) concluded that: \"Both sides in the arms race are ... confronted by the dilemma of steadily increasing military power and steadily decreasing national security. It is our considered profes- sional judgment that this dilemma has no technical solution. If the great pow- ers continue to look for solutions in the area of science and technology only, the result will be to worsen the situa- tion.\" I would like to focus your attention not on the subject of the article (na- tional security in a nuclear world) but on the kind of conclusion they reached, namely that there is no technical solu- tion to the problem. An implicit and almost universal assumption of discus- sions published in professional and semipopular scientific journals is that the problem under discussion has a technical solution. A technical solution may be defined as one that requires a change only in. the techniques of the natural sciences, demanding little or nothing in the way of change in human values or ideas of morality. In our day (though not in earlier times) technical solutions are always welcome. Because of previous failures in prophecy, it takes courage to assert that a desired technical solution is not possible. Wiesner and York exhibited this courage; publishing in a science journal, they insisted that the solution to the problem was not to be found in the natural sciences. They cautiously qualified their statement with the phrase, \"It is our considered profes-","line":5,"x":13.799999999999926,"y":96.05999999999992,"width":"5356.11","height":"12.60","fontName":["Courier"],"dir":["ltr"]}

Rather, the concern here is with the important concept of a class of human problems which can be called \"no technical solution problems,\" and, more specifically, with the identifi- cation and discussion of one of these. It is easy to show that the class is not a null class. Recall the game of tick- tack-toe. Consider the problem, \"How can I win. the game of tick-tack-toe?\" It is well known that I cannot, if I as- sume (in keeping with the conventions of game theory) that my opponent un- derstands the game perfectly. Put an- other way, there is no \"technical solu- tion\" to the problem. I can win only by giving a radical meaning to the word \"win.\" I can hit my opponent over the head; or I can drug him; or I can falsify the records. Every way in which I \"win\" involves, in some sense, an abandon- ment of the game, as we intuitively un- derstand it. (I can also, of course, openly abandon the game-refuse to play it. This is what most adults do.) The class of \"No technical solution problems\" has members. My thesis is that the \"population problem,\" as con- ventionally conceived, is a member of this class. How it is conventionally con- ceived needs some comment. It is fair to say that most people who' anguish over the population problem are trying to find a way to avoid the evils of over- population without relinquishing any of the privileges they now enjoy. They think that farming the seas or develop- ing new strains of wheat will solve the problem-technologically. I try to show here that the solution they seek cannot be found. The population problem can- not be solved in a technical way, any more than can the problem of winning the game of tick-tack-toe.","line":8,"x":189.83999999999983,"y":40.43999999999977,"width":"6202.27","height":"12.90","fontName":["Courier"],"dir":["ltr"]}

When this condition is met, what will be the situa- tion of mankind? Specifically, can Ben- tham's goal of \"the greatest good for the greatest number\" be realized? No-for two reasons, each sufficient by itself. The first is a theoretical one. It is not mathematically possible to maximize for two (or more) variables at the same time. This was clearly stated by von Neumann and Morgenstern (3), but the principle is implicit in the theory of partial differential equations, dating back at least to D'Alembert (1717- 1783). The second reason springs directly from biological facts. To live, any organism must have a source of energy (for example, food). This energy is utilized for two puposes: mere main- tenance and work. For man, mainte- nance of life requires about 1600 kilo- calories a day (\"maintenance calories'). Anything that he does over and above merely staying alive will be defined as work, and is supported by \"work cal- ories\" which he takes in. Work calories are used not only for what we call work in common speech; they are also re- quired for all forms of enjoyment, from swimming and automobile racing to playing music and writing poetry. If our goal is to maximize population it is obvious what we must do: We must make the work calories per person ap- proach as close to zero as possible. No gourmet meals, no vacations, no sports, no music, no literature, no art. .   . .

{"page":1,"change":"Addition","str":"argument or proof, that maximizing population does not max2imize goods. Bentham's goal is impossible. In reaching this conclusion I have made the usual assumption that it is the acquisition of energy that is the problem. The appearance of atomic energy has led some to question this assumption. However, given an infinite source of energy, population growth still produces an inescapable problem. The problem of the acquisition of en- ergy is replaced by the problem of its dissipation, as J. H. Fremlin has so wit- tily shown (4). The arithmetic signs in -t-he analysis are, as it were, reversed; but Bentham's goal is still unobtainable. The optimum population is, then, less than the maximum. The difficulty of defining the optimum is enormous; so far as I know, no one has seriously tackled this problem. Reaching an ac- ceptable and stable solution will surely require more than one generation of hard analytical work-and much per- suasion. We want the maximum good per person; but what is good? To one per- son it is wilderness, to another it is ski lodges for thousands. To one it is estu- aries to nourish ducks for hunters to shoot; to another it is factory land. Comparing one good with another is, we usually say, impossible because goods are incommensurable. Incommen- surables cannot be compared. Theoretically this may be true; but in real life incommensurables are commen- surable. Only a criterion of judgment and a system of weighting are needed. In nature the criterion is survival. Is it better for a species to be small and hide- able, or large and powerful? Natural selection commensurates the incommen- surables. The compromise achieved de- pends on a natural weighting of the values of the variables. Man must imitate this process. There is no doubt that in fact he already does, but unconsciously.

Of course, a positive growth rate might be taken as evidence that a pop- ulation is below its optimum. However, by any reasonable standards, the most rapidly growing populations on earth today are (in general) the most misera- ble. This association (which need not be invariable) casts doubt on the optimistic assumption that the positive growth rate of a population is evidence that it has yet to reach its optimum. We can make little progress in work- ing toward optimum poulation size until we explicitly exorcize the spirit of Adam Smith in the field of practical demography. In economic affairs, The Wealth of Nations (1776) popularized the \"invisible hand,\" the idea that an individual who \"intends only his own gain,\" is, as it were, \"led by an invisible hand to promote . .,. the public interest\" (5). Adam Smith did not assert that this was invariably true, and perhaps neither did any of his followers. But he contributed to a dominant tendency of thought that has ever since interfered with positive action based on rational analysis, namely, the tendency to as- sume that decisions reached individually will, in fact, be the best decisions for an entire society. If this assumption is correct it justifies the continuance of our present policy of laissez-faire in reproduction. If it is correct we can as- sume that men will control their individ- ual fecundity so as to produce the opti- mum population. If the assumption is not correct, we need to reexamine our individual freedoms to see which ones are defensible.","line":4,"x":216.8400000000002,"y":249.12000000000015,"width":"5854.87","height":"12.40","fontName":["Courier"],"dir":["ltr"]}

Picture a pasture open to all. It is to be expected that each herds- man will try to keep as many cattle as possible on the commons. Such an ar- rangement may work reasonably satis- factorily for centuries because tribal wars, poaching, and disease keep the numbers of both man and beast well below the carrying capacity of the land. Finally, however, comes the day of reckoning, that is, the day when the long-desired goal of social stability be- comes a reality. At this point, the in- herent logic of the commons remorse- lessly generates tragedy. As a rational being, each herdsman seeks to maximize his gain. Explicitly or implicitly, more or less consciously, he asks, \"What is the utility to me of adding one more animal to my herd?\" This utility has one negative and one positive component. 1) The positive component is a func- tion of the increment of one animal. Since the herdsman receives all the proceeds from the sale of the additional animal, the positive utility is nearly +1. 2) The negative component is a func- tion of the additional overgrazing created by one more animal. Since, however, the effects of overgrazing are shared by all the herdsmen, the negative utility for any particular decision- making herdsman is only a fraction of -1. Adding together the component par- tial utilities, the rational herdsman concludes that the only sensible course","line":13,"x":391.2000000000005,"y":282.06001000000015,"width":"5343.89","height":"12.40","fontName":["Courier"],"dir":["ltr"]}

A simple incident that occurred a few years ago in Leominster, Massachusetts, shows how perishable the knowledge is. During the Christmas shopping season the parking meters downtown were covered with plastic bags that bore tags reading: \"Do not open until after Christ- mas. Free parking courtesy of the mayor and city council.\" In other words, facing the prospect of an increased de- mand for already scarce space, the city fathers reinstituted the system of the commons. (Cynically, we suspect that they gained more votes than they lost by this retrogressive act.) In an approximate way, the logic of the commons has been understood for a long time, perhaps since the dis- covery of agriculture or the invention of private property in real estate. But it is understood mostly only in special cases which are not sufficiently general- ized. Even at this late date, cattlemen leasing national land on the western ranges demonstrate no more than an ambivalent understanding, in constantly pressuring federal authorities to increase the head count to the point where over- grazing produces erosion and weed- dominance. Likewise, the oceans of the world continue to suffer from the sur- vival of the philosophy of the commons. Maritime nations still respond automat- ically to the shibboleth of the \"freedom of the seas.\" Professing to believe in the \"inexhaustible resources of the oceans,\" they bring species after species of fish and whales closer to extinction (9). The National Parks present another instance of the working out of the tragedy of the commons. At present, they are open to all, without limit. The parks themselves are limited in extent- there is only one Yosemite Valley- whereas population seems to grow with- out limit. The values that visitors seek in the parks are steadily eroded. Plainly, we must soon cease to treat the parks as commons or they will be of no value to anyone. What shall we do? We have several options. We might sell them off as pri- vate property. We might keep them as public property, but allocate the right to enter them. The allocation might be on the basis of wealth, by the use of an auction system.

Here it is not a question of taking something out of the commons, but of putting something in-sewage, or chemical, radioactive, and heat wastes into water; noxious and danger- ous fumes into the air; and distracting and unpleasant advertising signs into the line of sight. The calculations of utility are much the same as before. The rational man finds that his share of the cost of the wastes he discharges into the commons is less than the cost of purifying his wastes before releasing them. Since this is true for everyone, we are locked into a system of \"fouling our own nest,\" so long as we behave only as independent, rational, free-enter- prisers. The tragedy of the commons as a food basket is averted by private prop- erty, or something formally like it. But the air and waters surrounding us can- not readily be fenced, and so the trag- edy of the commons as a cesspool must be prevented by different means, by co- ercive laws or taxing devices that make it cheaper for the polluter to treat his pollutants than to discharge them un- treated. We have not progressed as far with the solution of this problem as we have with the first. Indeed, our particu- lar concept of private property, which deters us from exhausting the positive resources of the earth, favors pollution. The owner of a factory on the bank of a stream-whose property extends to the middle of the stream-often has difficulty seeing why it is not his natural right to muddy the waters flowing past his door. The law, always behind the times, requires elaborate stitching and fitting to adapt it to this newly perceived aspect of the commons. The pollution problem is a con- sequence of population.

Using the commons as a cesspool does not harm the general public under frontier conditions, because there is no public; the same behavior in a metropo- lis is unbearable. A hundred and fifty years ago a plainsman could kill an American bison, cut out only the tongue for his dinner, and discard the rest of the animal. He was not in any impor- tant sense being wasteful. Today, with only a few thousand bison left, we would be appalled at such behavior. In passing, it is worth noting that the morality of an act cannot be determined from a photograph. One does not know whether a man killing an elephant or setting flre to the grassland is harming others until one knows the total system in which his act appears. \"One picture is worth a thousand words,\" said an ancient Chinese; but it may take 10,000 words to validate it. It is as tempting to ecologists as it is to reformers in general to try to persuade others by way of the photographic shortcut. But the essense of an argument cannot be photo- graphed: it must be presented rationally -in words. That morality is system-sensitive escaped the attention of most codifiers of ethics in the past. \"Thou shalt not . . .\" is the form of traditional ethical directives which make no allow- ance for particular circumstances. The laws of our society follow the pattern of ancient ethics, and therefore are poorly suited to governing a complex, crowded, changeable world. Our epicyclic solu- tion is to augment statutory law with administrative law. Since it is practically impossible to spell out all the conditions under which it is safe to burn trash in the back yard or to run an automobile without smog-control, by law we dele- gate the details to bureaus.

Confronted with appeals to limit breeding, some people will un- doubtedly respond to the plea more than others. Those who have more children will produce a larger fraction of the next generation than those with more susceptible consciences. The dif- ference will be accentuated, generation by generation. In C.

The argument has here been stated in the context of the population problem, but it applies equally well to any instance in which society appeals to an individual exploiting a commons to restrain himself for the general good-by means of his conscience.

Has any President during the past generation failed to call on labor unions to moder- ate voluntarily their demands for higher wages, or to steel companies to honor voluntary guidelines on prices? I can recall none. The rhetoric used on such occasions is designed to produce feel- ings of guilt in noncooperators. For centuries it was assumed without proof that guilt was a valuable, perhaps even an indispensable, ingredient of the civilized life. Now, in this post-Freudian world, we doubt it. Paul Goodman speaks from the modern point of view when he says: \"No good has ever come from feeling guilty, neither intelligence, policy, nor compassion. The guilty do not pay attention to the object but only to them- selves, and not even to their own in- terests, which might make sense, but to their anxieties\" (18). One does not have to be a profes- sional psychiatrist to see the conse- quences of anxiety. We in the Western world are just emerging from a dreadful two-centuries-long Dark Ages of Eros that was sustained partly by prohibi- tion laws, but perhaps more effectively by the anxiety-generating mechanisms of education. Alex Comfort has told the story well in The Anxiety Makers (19); it is not a pretty one. Since proof is difficult, we may even concede that the results of anxiety may sometimes, from certain points of view, be desirable. The larger question we should ask is whether, as a matter of policy, we should ever encourage the use of a technique the tendency (if not the intention) of which is psycholog- ically pathogenic. We hear much talk these days of responsible parenthood; the coupled words are incorporated into the titles of some organizations de- voted to birth control. Some people have proposed massive propaganda campaigns to instill responsibility into the nation's (or the world's) breeders. But what is the meaning of the word responsibility in this context? Is it not merely a synonym for the word con- science? When we use the word re- sponsibility in the absence of substantial sanctions are we not trying to browbeat a free man in a commons into acting against his own interest?
